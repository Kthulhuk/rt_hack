About Attack Toolkit
--------------------

The Attack Toolkit By JH is a simple CLI (command-line interface) allowing the user to perform attacks against another interface. This toolkit was made as a third-year project at ENSEA in the Networks and Communications Branch under the supervision of Christophe BARES. It was built upon the work of Giuliani Carlo and Montini Nicola from the University of Padova.

There are two types of functions in the toolkit : 

- Reconnaisance functions
- Denial of service functions
